# Jazz Chord Theory

What is a ii-V-I progression?
?
The most common jazz chord progression: minor 7th (ii) → dominant 7th (V) → major 7th (I). In C major: Dm7 → G7 → Cmaj7.

Tritone substitution::Replacing a dominant 7th chord with another dominant 7th whose root is a tritone away. E.g., Db7 substitutes for G7 because they share the same tritone (B and F).

Shell voicing:::A minimal chord voicing using only the root, 3rd, and 7th — omitting the 5th to create a lean, clear sound.

The ==rootless voicing== omits the root note (left for the bassist) and focuses on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and extensions.

What are upper structure triads?
?
Major or minor triads played over a dominant chord to produce extensions. E.g., E major triad over C7 yields C7(#9, #5, 7).

Guide tones:::The 3rd and 7th of a chord — the notes that define the chord quality and create smooth voice leading.

Altered dominant chord::A dominant 7th chord with one or more altered tensions: b9, #9, b5/#11, #5/b13. Used to create maximum tension before resolution.

What is a backdoor ii-V?
?
A bVII7 chord (or iv-bVII7) resolving to I major. E.g., in C major: Fm7 → Bb7 → Cmaj7. Creates a softer, more unexpected resolution than the standard ii-V-I.
