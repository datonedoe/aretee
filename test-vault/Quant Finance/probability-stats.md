# Probability & Statistics

Bayes' Theorem::P(A|B) = P(B|A) · P(A) / P(B)

What is the Central Limit Theorem?
?
The sum (or average) of a large number of independent, identically distributed random variables converges to a normal distribution, regardless of the original distribution.

Normal distribution:::Gaussian distribution

The ==standard deviation== measures the dispersion of a dataset relative to its mean.

Expected value of a discrete random variable::E[X] = Σ xᵢ · P(xᵢ)

What is a Poisson distribution used for?
?
Modeling the number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space, when events occur independently at a constant average rate λ. P(X=k) = (λ^k · e^(-λ)) / k!

Law of Large Numbers::As the number of trials increases, the sample mean converges to the expected value (population mean).

Variance:::The expected value of the squared deviation from the mean, Var(X) = E[(X - μ)²]

The ==correlation coefficient== (ρ) ranges from -1 to 1 and measures the linear relationship between two variables.

What is a Monte Carlo simulation?
?
A computational technique that uses repeated random sampling to estimate the probability distribution of outcomes. Widely used in derivatives pricing and risk management.
