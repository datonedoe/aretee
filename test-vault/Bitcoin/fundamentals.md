# Bitcoin Fundamentals

What is the Bitcoin stock-to-flow model?
?
A model that values Bitcoin based on its scarcity ratio: existing supply (stock) divided by annual production (flow). Higher S2F = more scarce = higher predicted value.

Bitcoin halving::An event every 210,000 blocks (~4 years) that cuts the block reward in half, reducing new BTC issuance. Next halving expected ~2028.

MVRV ratio:::Market Value to Realized Value — compares market cap to realized cap (each UTXO valued at its last moved price)

The ==hash rate== is the total computational power securing the Bitcoin network, measured in hashes per second.

What is Bitcoin's maximum supply?
?
21 million BTC. This hard cap is enforced by the protocol's consensus rules and halving schedule.

Difficulty adjustment::Every 2,016 blocks (~2 weeks), Bitcoin adjusts mining difficulty to maintain ~10 minute block times.

The ==mempool== is the set of unconfirmed transactions waiting to be included in a block by miners.

UTXO:::Unspent Transaction Output — the fundamental unit of Bitcoin's accounting model

What is a 51% attack?
?
An attack where an entity controlling >50% of hash rate could double-spend transactions or censor blocks. Economically impractical on Bitcoin due to enormous hash rate.

Lightning Network::A Layer 2 payment channel network built on Bitcoin enabling fast, low-cost off-chain transactions.
