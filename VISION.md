# Aretee — Vision

> *Arete (ἀρετή): Greek concept of excellence, virtue, reaching one's highest potential.*

## What Is Aretee?

A **personal learning OS** — Duolingo meets Anki meets podcast, powered by AI, designed to help you learn *anything* through every human sense.

Not just flashcards. A system that makes you **genuinely smarter** using the best learning methods humanity has ever discovered — and makes it so fun you forget you're studying.

## The Problem

You're drowning in information. Podcasts, X threads, articles, books, courses. You consume endlessly but retain almost nothing. Traditional flashcard apps are boring. Duolingo works but only for languages. There's no single app that:

- Uses **proven learning science** (not just rote memorization)
- Works across **any domain** (finance, languages, history, code)
- Engages **multiple senses** (read, listen, speak, interact)
- Makes learning **genuinely addictive** (not guilt-driven)
- Has **real stakes** (not just fake points)

## The Solution

Aretee combines six learning modes into one unified experience:

### 🃏 Flash Mode (Spaced Repetition)
Classic flashcard review with the Obsidian SR algorithm. Due cards, streak tracking, interval scheduling. The foundation — already built.

### 🏛️ Socratic Mode
AI plays Socrates. It doesn't give you answers — it asks probing questions that expose the gaps in your understanding. *"You said inflation is always bad — but what about debtors?"* Forces deep thinking.

### 🧠 Feynman Mode
Explain a concept back in simple terms. AI grades your explanation, identifies gaps, asks follow-ups. If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it. Richard Feynman's method, gamified.

### 🎧 Audio Mode
AI-generated podcasts, Socratic dialogues, and Feynman explanations from your flashcard content. Listen during drives, workouts, walks. Your personal learning podcast that adapts to what you need to review.

### 🎮 Quest Mode
Daily challenges, XP, levels, achievements, boss battles (hard concept reviews). Interleaving built in — quests mix topics to strengthen connections. RPG progression for your brain.

### 💀 SkinUP (Skin in the Game)
Put real money behind your commitment. Break your streak? $5 drains to an anti-charity. Pool-based system — deposit upfront, drain on failure. Loss aversion is 2x stronger than gain motivation.

## Target User

**Polymaths with ADHD energy.** People who want to learn everything — finance, languages, code, history — but struggle with consistency. High intake capacity, scattered execution. Aretee channels that energy into deep, retained knowledge.
